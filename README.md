## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a command-line terminal from scratch that integrates a core blockchain, enabling users to interact with decentralized applications and manage digital assets through customizable commands. The terminal will feature a "basket" function that allows users to add, remove, and process items for seamless transaction management within the blockchain environment.
